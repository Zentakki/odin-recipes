    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">As convenient as a store-bought mix can be, every home cook needs a good
         buttermilk pancake recipe in their repertoire. Don't have a tried-and-true
         favorite yet? You're in luck! The Allrecipes community can't get enough of
         these classic buttermilk pancakes. Reviewers say they're light, fluffy, moist,
         and full of rich flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: 3 cups</li>
        <li>Sugar: 3 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Baking powder: 3 teaspoons</li>
        <li>Baking soda: 1.5 teaspoons</li>
        <li>Salt: 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Buttermilk: 3 cups</li>
        <li>Milk: 1.5 cup</li>
        <li>Eggs: 3 large</li>
        <li>Butter: 0.3 cup, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
                 Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl.
                 Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
                 You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles,
                 it's ready.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork
                 to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little
                 lumpy which is what you want.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately
                 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface,
                  1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side.
                  Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
